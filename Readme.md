# Dryland PV vs. afforestation

Code and data related to our article on dryland PV and afforestation (see citation below). The repository is organised as follows:

  - Codes: Contains subfolders for 4 main parts, with calculations of:
    1) Calibration of UAV radiation measurements to the Eddy Covariance system mast
	2) Sensible heat flux and aerodynamic resistance
    3) The break-even time (BET) for our forest and PV sites
	4) The temperate and tropical zones' BET
  - Data: Related to subfolders 2-4 of code above
